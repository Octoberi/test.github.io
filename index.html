    <h1>What to watch</h1>
    <p>Dramatic and romantic films often have a special power to inspire, provoke thought, and influence audiences.
      These genres portray deep and complex human themes through compelling stories and profound characters. In dramas,
      we are often confronted with important life issues and challenges, which often lead to deeper connections with the
      story and characters. On the other hand, romantic films, inspired by love and human relationships, take us into an
      exciting world of emotions, passion, and excitement. They show us how love and human connections can be powerful
      and impactful, sometimes prompting us to contemplate deeper realities about life and human relationships. Overall,
      these films serve as a mirror, reflecting our emotions and experiences, and they can be influential and inspiring.
